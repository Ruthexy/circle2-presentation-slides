# API Basics - LMS Month 1 Week 3

# Application Programming Interface(API)

Responsibilities of a frontend engineer
There are two basic responsiblities :

- Building of UI(User Interface) which is the primary
  responsibility
- Ensuring the UI is functioning.

# API

What is an API?

API means Application Programming Interface. It is like a messenger that lets two systems talk to each
other. It provides a way to sign up and sign in.

# Example:

Practical example to help understand how API work:

When the frontend form submits data to a server
(like logging in), it uses an API to send that data to the
backend. The API then responds back with the result.

# Types of API requests:

There are several types of API requests, some are:

POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE......

# GET Request (Fetch or Retrieve Data)

What it does:

A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. It
is a single way to fetch Information from a particular
data base.

# Real life example:

Real life example of a get request:

sending a get request to the backend to fetch for user
Email, full name...from a form. also,
you can fetch the user id from the database.

# Code example - GET

Let‚Äôs say you open a weather app. The app sends a GET request to the API:

you send this:

```
GET https://weatherapi.com/today?city=Lagos
```

The server responds with:

```json
{
  "city": "Lagos",
  "temperature": "31¬∞C",
  "condition": "Sunny"
}
```

# GET Request Status codes:

Here are some status codes to note:

- 200 - OK
- 201 - Created

- 302 - Redirect
- 404 - Not found
- 403 - Forbidden
- 405 - Method not allowed
- 401 - Unauthorized
- 500 - Server Error

# POST Request (Send or Submit Data)

What it does:

A POST request is used to send data to the server, like
submitting a form. POST is to send out info.

# Real-life example

Below is an example of POST request:

You‚Äôre signing up on a site.

# Code example - POST

Let examine the code below:

The form sends a POST request:

```
POST https://api.example.com/signup
```

with this body:

```json
{
  "name": "Pelumi",
  "email": "pelumi@example.com",
  "password": "12345"
}
```

The server responds:

```json
{
  "message": "Signup successful",
  "userId": 107
}
```
